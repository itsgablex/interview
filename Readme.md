# Slang Interview Materials

Contents include:

1. The [roman numerals exercise](roman-numerals/Readme.md)
2. The [code reading exercise](code-reading/README.md)
3. The [architecture thinking exercise](architecture-thinking/README.md)


## 1. [Roman Numerals Exercise](roman-numerals/Readme.md)

This is a [code kata](http://codekata.com/)! As such, here's how we're going to approach this:

We'll use this kata to practice incremental development of code, using tests to set the direction of development (this is also known as Test-Driven-Development).

We - the candidate and the facilitator - will work on the code kata together as a pair.

The candidate will be expected to take the lead, but should expect that both parties should offer suggestions and take the keyboard at various times (technology permitting).

The objective is *not* to complete the exercise - we will not. Nor are we going to rate you based on details like IDE management, keyboard proficiency, etc.

Instead, we want to:
- see and hear how the candidate thinks
- see good behavior sharing code and ideas
- see your interest in code readability 
- see how we can make the code trust-worthy
- learn about the candidate's style and philosophy
- have fun, and show you what its like to work at Slang.

Ok enough of that, lets go!
