We’ll discuss a problem in the Slang domain, and we’d like the candidate to help us come up with solution proposals. We will do our best to talk through and answer any questions the candidate might have. We are trying to learn how the candidate engage with problems and considers solutions - show your work so we can achieve this! There is no right/wrong solution, and we’re looking for thoughtfulness and depth.
