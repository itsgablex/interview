## Goal

This is a code reading exercise. We want to see how you understand foreign code and how you can describe that code.

We also want to see how you approach learning about new and unusual code.

## Description

Tell us what each section of code does.

Feel free to use whatever tools you feel comfortable with to understand the code.

Through the whole process make sure to tell us what you are thinking and how you are approaching the problem.
